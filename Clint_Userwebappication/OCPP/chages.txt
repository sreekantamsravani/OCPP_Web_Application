Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

Run the command python -m venv myenv to create a new virtual environment called "myenv" in the current directory.

Once the virtual environment is created, activate it by running the command .\myenv\Scripts\activate.

You should see the name of the virtual environment appear in parentheses in the Command Prompt, indicating that it is now active.

Now, you can install any necessary packages or dependencies for your project within the virtual environment.

When you are finished working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the command deactivate.


pip install mysql-connector-python
